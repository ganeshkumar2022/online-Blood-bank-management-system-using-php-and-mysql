<h1><u>Facts about blood banking</u></h1>
<ul>
<li>According to the American Red Cross:
</li>
<li>About 36,000 units of blood are needed every day.
</li>
<li>The number of blood units donated is about 13.6 million a year.
</li>
<li>About 6.8 million volunteers are blood donors each year.
</li>
<li>Each unit of blood is broken down into components. These are red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitated AHF (cryo), a white blood cell called a granulocyte, and platelets. One unit of whole blood and its parts may be transfused to several people. Each person may have a different need.
</li>
<li>More than 21 million blood components are transfused each year.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood bank uses</h2>
<p>
A blood bank is a place where blood is collected and stored before it is used for transfusions. Blood banking takes place in the lab. This is to make sure that donated blood and blood products are safe before they are used. Blood banking also determines the blood type. The blood is also tested for infectious diseases
